You can browse items by feed and/or unread/saved status. There are two display modes;
expanded mode just lists the full items one after another, and list mode shows a list of
titles which can be expanded to see the item.

Items will be marked as read once they are opened in list mode, or when they are
scrolled to or selected in expanded mode. Once something is marked as read, it can
expire. An item can either be read or saved, but not both.

Feeds can be managed on the ``Manage feeds`` page. If a feed had a problem, its status
icon will be an orange warning, and if it is no longer available it will be a red error.
To see the reason for a warning or error, click somewhere on the row. To edit the feed's
settings, click on its title.
