### Step 1

1. Fetch the article page for a single Haaretz writer. Print the title, description, writer and date
2. Try to do the same for other writers as well
3. Take the data that was printed earlier and use [Feedgen](https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen) to create an RSS feed ([example](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp))
3. Final results: create a program that receives an Haaretz writer URL from stdin and in return prints the RSS result
